      # Front-end task of Code Challenge for Scoutbase

      This task is for demonstrating your understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React & related libraries.
      
      If youâ€™re doing the front-end only, you must use the https://countries.trevorblades.com endpoint for GraphQL API.
      
      ## Preferred libraries:
      
        - `styled-components` for styling
        - `apollo-client` for consuming GraphQL API
        - `react-router` or any alternative to implement routing
      
      ## Instructions:
      
      1. Create a `create-react-app` repo.
      2. Add a router with routes:
        - `/` - for displaying basic links for the other routes
        - `/countries` - for requesting GraphQL API and rendering the list
        - `/countries/(:code)` - for requesting GraphQL API and rendering the properties of a continent
      3. Design is totally by you.
      4. Countries list at `/countries` must contain the list of countries and the languages spoken in that country. Both in English and native languages. It should also contain the continent it is located in.
      5. `/countries/(:code)` must render the currency and a area code (phone) of that country.
      6. Routes must be fully loadable with a direct link. `/countries/CI` must render the page for Ivory Coast, for example.
      7. End.
